# E-Power-Notifier

### Abstract of Idea:

Electricity is the heart of today’s world. And now the world is going to be digital so electricity is very much important aspect. Generation and supply of electricity is the primary task of electricity board but it is also important to measure the power used by the consumer that is taking readings and generate the bills.Due to lack of proper availability of us- age statistics accessible from user end, the wastage of electricity is on a rise.


Electricity being a dominant source of energy, its wastage occurring every day in every possible way should be avoided and dealt with proper concern.Electricity will increase at certain rate till particu- lar units and then increase with more rate. So user should be intimated when consumption is about to reach that stage. So that he can reduce the consumption of electricity.This application focuses on creating an automated bill monitoring system that will automate the meter reading procedure by collecting the consumed electrical energy of houses and sends notification to the consumer when consumption reach particular units. The system will also encourage the users to reduce wastage of electricity which is an essential part of our everyday life.

### About Project & Model:

This is an application that is used for reducing electricity bills. This is a python pro-gram. It grabs few images from the electricity meter which is working and depending on the images and the units shown on the meter it sends a notification in the form of an email to the user when consumed electricity crosses the limit of usage. It uses OCR to recognize the seven-segment display which is shown on the meter.

### Objective:

• Here the main objective is to reduce the electricity bill.
• The main purpose is to send the notification to the user when he crosses the limit
in usage of electricity.
• Depending on the notification we can reduce the usage of electricity consump-
tion and reduce the bill.
• We can get the images of electricity meter.

## System Requirements

```
1. Python version greater than 3.6
2. Computer vision (cv2)
3. Easy OCR
4. Matplotlib
5. imutils
6. SMPT Library for email notifications
```
